# ![Logo](src/main/resources/nbtexporter_logo_32x32.png) NBT Exporter

NBT Exporter is a simple client-side mod that allows players to export NBT data of items from their inventory.

## Usage
![!](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=!&color=yellow) This mod only exports NBT data, **not item IDs, stack counts, or damage values**.

Hold the item you want to export NBT for, and use the `/exportnbt` command.

You can use it like that:
```
/exportnbt MyUniqueItem
```

...or like that:
```
/exportnbt "My Unique Item, but with spaces"
```

Providing a file name is optional. If not specified, the file will use the current date and time as the name.
